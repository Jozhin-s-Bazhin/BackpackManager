### BACKPACK MANAGER ###

# Tired of carrying unnecessary weight? Let BackpackManagerâ„¢ take the job and make the perfect configuration of folders to minimise your back pain!


# Data structure: There are 4 classes, Subject() which represents one subject you need to carry and has a name and weight, Day() which represents a day with a list of subjects you need to bring that day,
# Folder() which represents a folder you carry one or more subjects in with its own weight and the weight of all the subjects in it, Configuration() which represents a certain combination of folders that should achieve a minimal average weight with a list of folders




# Initialising the classes and variables used for the optimisation algorithm
